## Swift Basics: Apple promo 
## Created by Roots : Mohammad, Yolanda, Alexandre, Henri, Shelley
Our group was given the task to create an App regarding the environment. Our group decided to create an app to help everyday people take small actions in the hope that small things add up to bigger things. We wanted to motivate and teach individuals how to change their habits, and we based our model on positive reinforcement. We imagined that each positive action would give  points to each individual player. We also thought that groups stimulate and would help keep up the momentum - so we also wanted individuals to be able create or join goups. 

# Technical Talk
## Xcode and Swift
* We  used an MVC architecture, 
* we didn't have a database so we mocked one with a file - actionsDB.swif
*  Xcode Version 10.3 (10G8)
* For the list of actions we wanted to create a segmented view but didnt have the time to finish the logic.

```
